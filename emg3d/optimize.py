def adjointstate(simulation):
    r"""Compute the discrete gradient using the adjoint-state method.

    The discrete gradient for a single source at a single frequency is given by
    Equation (10) of [PlMu08]_:

    .. math::

        -\sum_{k,l,m}\mathbf{\bar{\lambda}}^E_x
               \frac{\partial S}{\partial \textbf{p}} \textbf{E}_x
        -\sum_{k,l,m}\mathbf{\bar{\lambda}}^E_y
               \frac{\partial S}{\partial \textbf{p}} \textbf{E}_y
        -\sum_{k,l,m}\mathbf{\bar{\lambda}}^E_z
               \frac{\partial S}{\partial \textbf{p}} \textbf{E}_z  ,

    where the grid notation (:math:`\{k, l, m\}` and its :math:`\{+1/2\}`
    equivalents) have been ommitted for brevity, except in the :math:`\sum`
    symbols.


    Parameters
    ----------
    ffields, bfields : dict
        Dictionary (over sources and frequencies) containing the forward and
        backward electric fields.

    grids : dict
        Dictionary containing the grids corresponding to the provided fields.

    mesh : TensorMesh
        Model grid, on which the gradient is computed; a
        ``emg3d.utils.TensorMesh`` instance.

    wdepth : dict or None
        Parameter-dict for depth weighting.


    Returns
    -------
    grad : ndarray
        Current gradient; has shape mesh.vnC (same as model properties).
