A multigrid solver for 3D electromagnetic diffusion with tri-axial electrical
anisotropy. The matrix-free solver can be used as main solver or as
preconditioner for one of the Krylov subspace methods implemented in
:mod:`scipy.sparse.linalg`, and the governing equations are discretized on a
staggered Yee grid. The code is written completely in Python using the
``numpy``/``scipy``-stack, where the most time- and memory-consuming parts are
sped up through jitted ``numba``-functions.
